## About
Hell Racer is a single player kart game set in hell. You play as an imp and will race the ghost of your own racing lap records.

## Responsibilities
A kart game involves numerous mechanics, but to ensure the gameplay is fun and exciting, the most crucial aspect is movement. Among these, the drifting mechanic stands out as particularly important. I was primarily responsible for developing this key drifting mechanic, along with creating the ghost system and a significant portion of the user interface (UI).
