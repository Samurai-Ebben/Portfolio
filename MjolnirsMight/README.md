The whole idea of the game, personally is for me to test my abilities and create something all by myself. And i have always found the throwing mechanic in God Of War (Norse myth) very intreging and i wanted to try and duplicate it myself.

In this three weeks project i didn't only make the system for throwing the hammer but i also modeled the hammer myself, using Blender.
and designed the levels, showing my love for puzzles.
