The primary objective of this game project is to challenge myself and test my abilities by creating something entirely on my own. I have always found the throwing mechanic in God of War (Norse mythology) particularly intriguing, and I wanted to replicate that mechanic in my own way.

Over the course of this three-week project, I not only developed a system for throwing the hammer, but also modeled the hammer using Blender. Additionally, I designed the levels, showcasing my passion for puzzle-based gameplay.

Furthermore, I experimented with shaders and materials to create the visual effects of thunder emanating from the hammer.
